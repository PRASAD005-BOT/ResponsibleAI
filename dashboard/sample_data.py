        # Practical Guide to AI Fairness Testing
        
        ## Introduction
        This guide provides practical approaches to testing machine learning models for fairness and bias. It focuses on implementable techniques that can be integrated into existing ML development workflows.
        
        ## Fairness Metrics Overview
        
        ### Group Fairness Metrics
        - **Statistical Parity**: Ensure equal positive prediction rates across groups
        - **Equal Opportunity**: Ensure equal true positive rates across groups
        - **Predictive Parity**: Ensure equal precision across groups
        - **Equalized Odds**: Ensure equal true positive and false positive rates
        
        ### Individual Fairness Metrics
        - **Consistency**: Similar individuals should receive similar predictions
        - **Counterfactual Fairness**: Predictions should not change based on protected attributes
        
        ## Implementation Workflow
        
        ### 1. Define Fairness Objectives
        - Identify protected groups relevant to your application
        - Select appropriate fairness metrics based on context
        - Define acceptable thresholds for fairness disparities
        
        ### 2. Prepare Testing Data
        - Ensure representative test data with adequate subgroup samples
        - Consider synthetic data generation for underrepresented groups
        - Validate data quality and feature distributions
        
        ### 3. Implement Testing Pipeline
        ```python
        # Pseudocode example
        from fairness_metrics import calculate_disparate_impact, equal_opportunity_diff
        
        # Test model on different groups
        results_by_group = {}
        for group in protected_groups:
            group_data = test_data[test_data[protected_attribute] == group]
            group_predictions = model.predict(group_data)
            results_by_group[group] = evaluate(group_predictions, group_data.labels)
        
        # Calculate fairness metrics
        di_score = calculate_disparate_impact(results_by_group)
        eo_diff = equal_opportunity_diff(results_by_group)
        
        # Report results
        print(f"Disparate Impact: {di_score}")
        print(f"Equal Opportunity Difference: {eo_diff}")
        ```
        
        ### 4. Interpret Results
        - Analyze patterns across different metrics
        - Investigate sources of disparities
        - Consider trade-offs between different fairness metrics
        
        ### 5. Implement Mitigation Strategies
        - **Pre-processing**: Reweighting, sampling, feature transformation
        - **In-processing**: Fairness constraints, adversarial debiasing
        - **Post-processing**: Threshold adjustment, calibration
        
        ## Case Studies
        
        ### Example: Credit Scoring Model
